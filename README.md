# MD_CBL-Group_2

## Project Overview

This project develops an automated, data-driven police demand forecasting system to help reduce residential burglary 
in London. 
By combining time-series forecasting with socio-economic factors, 
our solution enables police forces to forecast the future burglaries in each ward, and efficiently allocate resources
with our police allocation formula depending on the burglary numbers.

### Key Features:
- Hybrid SARIMA forecasting with socio-economic optimization
- Ward-level predictions with one-month granularity
- Oscillation capture metrics for model evaluation
- Dashboard integration for visual resource planning

## Methodology

Our hybrid approach combines three key components:

1. **Time-Series Forecasting**: SARIMA models capture temporal patterns in burglary data
2. **Socio-Economic Integration**: 
   - Ward clustering based on social-economic factors
   - Cluster-specific model parameterization
   - MAE optimization for models with linear regression fitted with social-economic factors
3. **Model Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Average Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
   - Oscillation Capture Score (OCS)
   - Variability Ratio (VR)
   - Smoothness Penalty (SP)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvatsugDnalloR/MD_CBL-Group_2.git
```
$\hspace{0.8cm}$**Note**: make sure that `gitlfs` is installed before cloning, if not you can simply install it by
```bash
git lfs install
```
2. Install dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`. if you use `uv` as package manager, simply just run 
```bash
uv sync
```
$\hspace{0.8cm}$If you only need to run the dashboard,
   the only dependencies that you have to install is `numpy`, `pandas`, `geopandas`,
`plotly`, and `dash`.

## Usage

### Data Cleaning
Make sure that the original burglaries dataset downloaded from the [UK police website](https://data.police.uk/data/)
and simply run the `clean_data.py` script.

### Performance Comparison between **Na√Øve Forecasting Model** and **Hybrid Forecasting Model**
The Python scripts and jupyter notebooks for performance testing of models are all in `model_performance_testing` module, 
so all the scripts and notebooks mentioned below are inside this module.

The naive model is powered by SARIMA model with auto-fitting function from `pmdarima` package, 
which is a common work-flow for time-series forecasting project using SARIMA model. 
To see the standard metrics (MAE and RMSE) of the naive model and all the orders + seasonal orders of SARIMA model
determined by `pmdarima`, run the scripts `finetune_ward_models.py`, and the orders of the model will be output as a csv.
To see more further testing with self-defined fitting scores mentioned above (OCS, VR and SP), run the notebook
`autoarima_fitting.ipynb`, which also provides further visualisation of the model for each ward.

The Hybrid Forecasting model is described above, and to see a complete step-by-step workflow from loading data to model
performance after MAE optimisation, see and run the notebook `clustering_sarima_opt.ipynb`. 
There is also optional visualisation provided in the notebook.

### Generate Forecast
Run the main forecasting pipeline `social_economic_sarima.py`, which will:
1. Load and preprocess data 
2. Cluster wards by socio-economic factors 
3. Train optimized SARIMA models 
4. Generate March-December 2025 forecasts 
5. Save results to `forecasts_output/2025_burglary_forecasts.csv`

### Dashboard
All the dashboard-related files are in the `dashboard` module. 
To run the dashboard, simply run the `app.py` script in the module. 
Note that the dashboard is running on the localhost.

**TODO: add more description for the functionality of the dashboard**

## Summary of Key Findings
1. Serious underfitting issue for the models fitted by `pmdarima`:
   - There exists ward with prediction without a seasonal order, causing the forecasting to be a straight line.
   - There exists ward with prediction of smooth exponential decreasing line, seriously underfitted.
2. Correlation between social-economic factors and burglary data properties (for data after 2020):
   - The Percentage of Households Owning No Car has a negative correlation with the Volatility of the burglaries of each 
ward with a relatively strong correlation coefficient of about -0.47
   - The Percentage of Households Owning No Car has a positive correlation with the Average Absolute Difference of the
burglaries of each ward with a relatively strong correlation coefficient of about 0.52
   - The Percentage of Households with Bedroom Occupancy Rating of 0 has a negative correlation with the Volatility 
of the burglaries of each ward with a relatively strong correlation coefficient of about -0.47
   - The Percentage of Households with Bedroom Occupancy Rating of 0 has a positive correlation with the
Average Absolute Difference of the burglaries of each ward with a relatively strong correlation coefficient of about 0.48
3. Improvement of the Hybrid Model:
   - With only cluster-specific SARIMA order optimisation, compared to the best outcome of auto-fitted models, 
there is on average a 5% improvement on both MAE and RMSE scores, while for the best performed cluster, 
there is a 15% improvement on those scores.
   - With further MAE optimisation, compared to the best outcome of auto-fitted models, 
there is on average 15% improvement on both MAR and RMSE scores, while for the best performed cluster, 
there is a 25% improvement on those scores.
   - Underfitting issue has been resolved, which can be shown from both the improvement on the fitting scores and visualisations.
